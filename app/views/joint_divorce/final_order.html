        <p>If you still want to get divorced but you do not think your husband or wife will confirm the final order then you can change to a sole application.
          This means your husband or wife will become the respondent.
        </p>


          <p>You should still continue and confirm you want to finalise your divorce below. If your husband or wife does not also confirm within 2 weeks then you will be able to finalise your divorce as a sole applicant.
            You will receive an email with information on how to change your application, if they do not apply.
