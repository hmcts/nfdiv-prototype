                    How to finalise your divorce
                  </h1>


                  <p>The quickest way to finalise your divorce is to ask your husband or wife to confirm your joint application for a final order. They have been emailed details of how to do this. </p>

<p>If they will not confirm then you can apply for a final order as a sole applicant. To do this you need to follow these steps:  </p>


              <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/952032/d36-eng.pdf">Download and fill out an application for a final order</a> (as a sole applicant).</li>
                <li>Give notice to your husband or wife that you are intending to apply for a final order as a sole applicant. You can do this by sending them a draft copy of the application by email or post.  You will need to fill out <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/952023/n215-eng.pdf">a ‘certificate of service’ form</a> to prove to the court that you have given them notice.  </li>
                <li> Wait 14 days to give your husband or wife time to respond. Then upload the following documents: </li>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/952032/d36-eng.pdf">application for a Final Order</a> (as a sole applicant)</li>
