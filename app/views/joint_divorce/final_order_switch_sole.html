                    How to finalise your divorce
                  </h1>


                  <p>The quickest way to finalise your divorce is to get your husband or wife to confirm your joint application for a final order. They have been emailed details of how to do this. </p>

<p>If they will not do this then you can apply to finalise your divorce as a sole applicant.  </p>

                  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                    <li><a href="#">Download and fill out an application for a final order</a> (as a sole applicant).</li>
                    <li>Give notice to your husband or wife that you are intending to apply for a final order as a sole applicant. You can do this by sending them a draft copy of the application by email or post. You should keep evidence that you have sent it.</li>
                    <li>Wait 2 weeks, to give them time to respond to the notice that you are intending to serve them.</li>
                    <li>After 2 weeks, then ‘serve’ (send) them the application for a final order. You will need to prove to the court that you have served them the application. You could use a private professional to serve them, such as a ‘process server’. You can find a process server online. </li>
                    <li>Send the following documents and evidence to the court:</li>

                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>The application for a Final Order (as a sole applicant)</li>
                      <li>Proof that you have given notice that you intend to serve the application for a Final Order on your husband or wife. For example, the email or letter you sent them with a draft copy of the application. </li>
                      <li>A statement confirming that you have given notice to your husband or wife that you are intending to serve them the application for a final order. The statement should also confirm that at least 14 days has passed between notifying them of your intention to serve and actually ‘serving’ them the application for a final order. </li>
                      <li>The application for a Final Order (as a sole applicant)</li>
                      <li>A ‘certificate of service’ which proves that the application for a Final Order was served on your husband or wife.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ol>


                  <p>You can either post or email the documents and evidence to the court. Details of where to send them are on any correspondence you have received from the court. </p>
