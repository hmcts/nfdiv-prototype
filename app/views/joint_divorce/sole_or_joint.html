      This divorce application costs £550. You have to pay the fee in a sole or a joint application because you are the first applicant. You and your {{ data['husband-wife'] }} should agree how to split the fee, but the payment system can only allow the first applicant to pay.

  <br><br>
        Help can be claimed to pay the fee, if the applicant:
<br><br>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>is on certain benefits <i>or</i></li>
  <li>has little or no savings <i>or</i></li>
  <li>has low income</li>
</ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">      In a sole application, only you have to be eligible and claim help with fees. In a joint application, both you and your {{ data['husband-wife'] }} have to be eligible and claim help with fees separately.   </p>
