        <p>Your financial rights will change after the divorce is finalised. If you have not settled your finances then you should save and sign out and seek legal advice.
        </p>



        <p>Your husband or wife has already confirmed this joint application.
          If you do not confirm then they can still apply to finalise the divorce as a sole applicant.
          This will mean you will become the respondent and the divorce could be finalised without your confirmation.
          They must give you 14 days notice if they intend to do this.
         </p>


        <p>If you want to settle your finances before the divorce is finalised then you can apply to delay the final order.
          You can do this by filling out a <a href="#">‘general application’ D11 form</a> and sending it to the court.
          You only need to apply to delay the final order if you receive notice from your husband or wife that they are going to apply to finalise the divorce as a sole applicant. </p>

You can do this by sending them a draft copy of the application by email or post.  You will need to fill out <a href="#">a ‘certificate of service’ form</a> to prove to the court that you have given them notice.  </li>
                <li>You have to give your husband or wife 14 days to respond, starting from the day they are ‘served’ the application. After 14 days, then send the following documents and evidence to the court:  </li>
