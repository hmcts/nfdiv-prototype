      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Latest update</h2>

      <div class="govuk-panel govuk-panel--confirmation" style="background-color: #F2F8F5; text-align: left;">



        <p> You have responded to the divorce application. You do not have to do anything further.  </p>

        <p> The next step is for your husband or wife to apply for a 'conditional order'. This is a document that says that the court does not see any reason why you cannot divorce. </p>

<p>Your husband or wife can apply for a conditional order from 9 February 2022.
This is because they have to wait 20 weeks from when the divorce application was issued. You will receive an email when the conditional order has been granted.
 </p>

<p>

  After the conditional order, they need to apply for a final order, which legally ends the marriage. This cannot be made until 6 weeks after the conditional order

  </p>



    <p>You can use the time to decide how your money and property will be divided.
      This is dealt with separately to the divorce application. <a href="">Find out more about dividing money and property </a></p>


        <!--



  <p >  Your application for divorce has been submitted and checked by court staff. It has now been ‘issued’ to you and your husband or wife by email.</p>

  <p >You have to confirm that you have received and accept the application for divorce. This is known as ‘acknowledging service’.</p>

  <p >Your divorce application cannot progress until both you and your husband or wife have ‘acknowledged service’.</p>
