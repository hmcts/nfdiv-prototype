        You need to get a ‘certified translation’ of your marriage certificate 
      </h1>

      <p>You need to get your marriage certificate translated into English and certified. You can find translation companies online which also do certification as part of their service.</p>
        
      <p>When you have your translated and certified marriage certificate then return to this application and continue. You will be asked to upload a photo of it later, or post it in.</p>    
        
        <p>If you have a translated certificate that is not certified then you need to get it certified by a ‘notary public’. You can find a notary public through the <a href="https://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk" class="govuk-link">Notaries Society</a> or the <a href="https://scrivener-notaries.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Society of Scrivener Notaries</a>.</p>
