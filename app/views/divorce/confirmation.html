        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Apply to serve the divorce papers another way</h3>

        <p>You need to apply to serve the divorce papers to your husband or wife another way. For example, by email, text message or social media. This is because you did not provide their address in the application.</p>

        <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-8"></div>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What happens next</h2>
        <p>Your application will be checked by court staff. You will receive an email notification by [date + 2 days] confirming whether it has been accepted. Your husband or wife will then be sent a copy of the application. They will be asked to check the information and respond. </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Dividing your money and property</h3>

        <p>It’s usually more straightforward and less expensive if you agree with your husband or wife on how to divide your money and property. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/money-property-when-relationship-ends/mediation" class="govuk-link">Get help agreeing</a>.</p>

        <p>If you do agree then you can make the agreement legally binding. This is known as asking the court to make a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/money-property-when-relationship-ends/apply-for-consent-order" class="govuk-link">‘consent order’</a>.</p>

        <p>If you disagree then you can ask the court to decide for you. This is known as applying for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/money-property-when-relationship-ends/get-court-to-decide" class="govuk-link">‘financial order’</a>.</p>
