  How to proceed with your divorce

    </h1>


  <!-- <p >

    The divorce application was sent to the following address:
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    23 Stanley Street	<br>
    Farnborough <br>
    UK <br>
    FO54 3RD <br>
  </ul> -->

  <p>
    The court usually needs to hear from both parties in a marriage before it can grant a divorce.

    It’s therefore important that your husband or wife responds to your application.

  </p>

<br>
  <div class="govuk-warning-text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
    <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
      <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    <div style="margin-top: -22px; margin-left: 5px;">
  The simplest way to proceed is for you to contact your husband or wife and ask them to respond, if it’s safe to do so.  They can still respond, even though the deadline has passed.

<!--
 <p>
  If you cannot get in contact with your husband or wife, you may want to consider asking their family, friends and workplace if they have a new address.  Then send that to the court, using the contact details in the ‘Getting help’ section on this page.
</p>
-->

  <p>
If they still do not respond then you can choose one of the following options to progress your application, depending on your situation.
