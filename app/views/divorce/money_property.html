                  It’s usually more straightforward and less expensive if you agree with your husband or wife on how to divide your savings, property, pensions and other assets. There are mediation services available to help you come to an agreement.

                  If you agree then you can make your agreement legally binding. This is known as asking the court to make a ‘consent order’. There is an additional fee of £50. You can get legal advice or ask a solicitor to draft a consent order for you. You will be given links to further guidance after you have submitted this application. </p>

                  If you disagree then you can ask the court to decide for you. This is known as applying for a ‘financial order’. You can also apply for a financial order for your children, if appropriate. The court can also order maintenance payments to be made. </p>

                    The court can only make financial orders for children under certain circumstances. You can come to an agreement with your husband or wife and make it legally binding with a consent order, or you can use the Child Maintenance Service.
